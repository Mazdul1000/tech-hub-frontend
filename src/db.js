Until March 30, about its performance metrics Although we won't get to know, several leaked benchmarks from earlier have told us that chips such as the Intel Core i7-11700K can hold their own against similarly-specced AMD counterparts. The Intel Core i7-11700K has 16MB of L3 cache and operates at 3.6 GHz by default, but can boost up to 5 GHz, depending on the workload. This Intel 11th Gen Core i7-11700k Rocket Lake Processor featured with CPU Cores: 8, CPU Threads: 16, Turbo (8 Cores): 4.60 GHz, Core architecture: normal. Here used Intel Iris Xe Graphics 32 (Rocket Lake S), that featured with GPU frequency: 0.40 GHz, GPU (Turbo): 1.35 GHz, Generation: 12, DirectX Version: 12, Execution units: 32, Shader: 256, Max. GPU Memory: 16 GB, Max. displays: 3, Technology: 14 nm. Intel is building the Core i7-11700K on a 14 nm production process, the transistor count is unknown.
